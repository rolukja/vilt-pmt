# VILT Project Management

A lightweight project management tool developed with the VILT stack. It is designed for individuals and small teams to efficiently organize their IT projects.

## Purpose

The goal of this tool is to simplify and streamline the management of IT projects. With a focus on Kanban functionality, it blends the best elements of Jira, Redmine, and ClickUp – but with a deliberately reduced feature set.

## Features (Planned)

- Management of multiple projects (for individuals and teams)
- Tasks and Subtasks
- Milestones
- Kanban board for visual organization
- Image upload for tasks and projects
- Code library for storing code snippets

## Development Status

The project is in its very early stages. Currently, the layout is being designed, and configurations are being set up. The implementation of core logic will follow in subsequent phases.

## Technology Stack

The tool is built using the VILT stack:
- **Vue 3**
- **Inertia.js**
- **Laravel 11**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it’s bug fixes, new features, or suggestions for improvement – all feedback helps make this tool better.
